//! # AEVOR-VM: Revolutionary Execution Environment with TEE Integration
//!
//! This crate provides the hyper-performant execution environment that enables smart contracts
//! to access AEVOR's revolutionary capabilities through TEE integration, mixed privacy coordination,
//! and mathematical verification. The virtual machine demonstrates genuine blockchain trilemma
//! transcendence by providing execution capabilities that enhance rather than compromise security,
//! decentralization, and performance characteristics simultaneously.
//!
//! ## Revolutionary Virtual Machine Capabilities
//!
//! ### Deterministic Parallel Execution with Mathematical Verification
//!
//! AEVOR's virtual machine enables transaction-level parallel execution through sophisticated
//! dependency analysis that identifies independent operations for simultaneous processing while
//! maintaining mathematical guarantees about execution correctness and state consistency. This
//! approach eliminates the sequential execution bottlenecks that constrain traditional blockchain
//! virtual machines while providing stronger correctness guarantees through TEE attestation.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use aevor_vm::{
//!     core::execution_engine::{ParallelExecutionEngine, DependencyAnalyzer},
//!     parallel_execution::execution_coordination::{ParallelExecution, SchedulingOptimization},
//!     verification::mathematical_verification::MathematicalExecutionVerification
//! };
//!
//! // Revolutionary parallel execution with mathematical verification
//! let execution_engine = ParallelExecutionEngine::create_with_tee_integration()?;
//! let dependency_analyzer = DependencyAnalyzer::create_for_parallel_optimization()?;
//! let parallel_coordinator = ParallelExecution::create_with_mathematical_verification()?;
//! 
//! // Execute independent transactions simultaneously with mathematical guarantees
//! let execution_result = execution_engine.execute_parallel_transactions(
//!     &transactions,
//!     &dependency_analyzer,
//!     &parallel_coordinator
//! ).await?;
//! 
//! assert!(execution_result.provides_mathematical_correctness_guarantees());
//! ```
//!
//! ### TEE-Enhanced Smart Contract Execution
//!
//! Smart contracts gain access to hardware-backed secure execution environments that enable
//! confidential computation, privacy-preserving coordination, and mathematical verification
//! impossible with traditional virtual machines. TEE integration provides superior security
//! guarantees while maintaining performance characteristics that make sophisticated applications
//! practical for real-world deployment.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use aevor_vm::{
//!     contracts::lifecycle::{ContractDeployment, TeeEnhancedContract},
//!     tee_integration::secure_execution::{SecureExecutionEnvironment, DataProtection},
//!     privacy::confidential_computation::{PrivateExecution, ResultAttestation}
//! };
//!
//! // Deploy contract with TEE integration and privacy capabilities
//! let contract_deployment = ContractDeployment::create_with_tee_integration()?;
//! let secure_environment = SecureExecutionEnvironment::allocate_for_contract()?;
//! let private_execution = PrivateExecution::create_with_mathematical_verification()?;
//!
//! let deployed_contract = contract_deployment.deploy_with_privacy_guarantees(
//!     contract_bytecode,
//!     &secure_environment,
//!     &private_execution
//! ).await?;
//!
//! assert!(deployed_contract.provides_confidential_execution_capabilities());
//! ```
//!
//! ### Cross-Platform Behavioral Consistency
//!
//! The virtual machine provides identical execution behavior across Intel SGX, AMD SEV,
//! ARM TrustZone, RISC-V Keystone, and AWS Nitro Enclaves while enabling platform-specific
//! optimization that maximizes performance without creating platform dependencies or
//! compromising functional consistency.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use aevor_vm::{
//!     cross_platform::consistency::{ExecutionConsistency, BehavioralVerification},
//!     tee_integration::platform_coordination::{MultiPlatformExecution, PlatformAbstraction},
//!     optimization::execution::{PlatformOptimization, PerformanceAdaptation}
//! };
//!
//! // Cross-platform execution with behavioral consistency guarantees
//! let consistency_manager = ExecutionConsistency::create_for_all_platforms()?;
//! let platform_coordinator = MultiPlatformExecution::create_with_optimization()?;
//! let behavioral_verification = BehavioralVerification::create_with_mathematical_precision()?;
//!
//! let execution_result = platform_coordinator.execute_with_consistency_guarantees(
//!     contract_execution,
//!     &consistency_manager,
//!     &behavioral_verification
//! ).await?;
//!
//! assert!(execution_result.maintains_identical_behavior_across_platforms());
//! ```
//!
//! ## Architectural Excellence and Performance Protection
//!
//! ### No Homomorphic Encryption - Superior Privacy Through Hardware
//!
//! AEVOR's virtual machine eliminates computationally expensive cryptographic techniques
//! that would destroy revolutionary throughput goals. TEE-based privacy provides superior
//! confidentiality guarantees with 1.1x-1.3x computational overhead compared to homomorphic
//! encryption's 1000x-1,000,000x overhead, enabling practical privacy applications.
//!
//! ### Mathematical Certainty Through Design
//!
//! Every execution operation provides mathematical certainty through TEE attestation and
//! architectural design rather than probabilistic verification requiring computational
//! overhead. This approach enables immediate finality with stronger guarantees while
//! achieving superior performance characteristics.
//!
//! ### Infrastructure Capabilities vs Application Policies
//!
//! The virtual machine maintains strict separation between execution infrastructure that
//! enables unlimited innovation and application policies that implement specific business
//! logic. This architectural discipline ensures that sophisticated execution capabilities
//! enhance rather than constrain application development flexibility.
