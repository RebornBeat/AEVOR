# BREAKDOWN_RELATIONSHIPS.md Guideline

## Purpose
The purpose of BREAKDOWN_RELATIONSHIPS.md is to provide a detailed overview of the relationships and dependencies between modules, groups, and files within the codebase.

## Structure
1. Module-level Dependencies:
   - List each module and its dependencies on other modules
   - Identify the specific files within each module that have dependencies on files from other modules

2. Group-level Dependencies:
   - Within each module, list the groups (based on functionality) and their dependencies on other groups within the same module or across different modules
   - Identify the specific files within each group that have dependencies on files from other groups

3. File-level Dependencies:
   - For each file, list its dependencies on other files within the same module or across different modules
   - Identify the specific functions or components within each file that have dependencies on functions or components from other files

4. Dependency Direction:
   - Clearly indicate the direction of dependencies (e.g., Module A depends on Module B, File X depends on File Y)
   - Use appropriate formatting or symbols to denote the direction of dependencies

5. Dependency Type:
   - Specify the type of dependency (e.g., function call, data structure usage, configuration usage)
   - Use consistent terminology and formatting to denote the type of dependencies

6. Criticality and Impact:
   - Assess the criticality and impact of each dependency
   - Identify dependencies that are critical for the functioning of the codebase and highlight them accordingly

7. Potential Optimizations:
   - Identify any circular dependencies or unnecessary dependencies that can be refactored or optimized
   - Suggest potential improvements or architectural changes to simplify the dependency structure

## Best Practices
- Keep the documentation up to date with the codebase
- Use clear and consistent formatting throughout the document
- Provide examples or code snippets to illustrate complex dependencies
- Regularly review and update the document as the codebase evolves
