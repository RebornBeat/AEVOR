//! # AEVOR-EXECUTION: Multi-TEE Orchestration and Coordination Architecture
//!
//! This crate provides the sophisticated multi-TEE orchestration capabilities that enable AEVOR's
//! revolutionary blockchain applications to span multiple secure execution environments while
//! maintaining mathematical consistency, security boundaries, and performance optimization that
//! transcends traditional blockchain execution limitations through deterministic parallel
//! coordination and hardware-backed verification.
//!
//! ## Revolutionary Multi-TEE Coordination Philosophy
//!
//! ### Deterministic Parallel Execution Through Mathematical Verification
//! 
//! AEVOR-EXECUTION eliminates the probabilistic execution approaches that constrain traditional
//! blockchain systems by providing deterministic parallel execution with mathematical verification
//! that enables applications to achieve capabilities impossible with traditional blockchain
//! technology while maintaining performance characteristics that exceed software-only approaches.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use aevor_execution::{
//!     core::{ExecutionEngine, CoordinationManager, ResourceAllocator},
//!     multi_tee::{ServiceOrchestration, StateCoordination, LoadBalancing},
//!     privacy::{BoundaryManagement, CrossPrivacyCoordination, ConfidentialityManagement}
//! };
//!
//! // Revolutionary multi-TEE coordination enabling distributed secure execution
//! let execution_engine = ExecutionEngine::create_multi_platform_coordination()?;
//! let coordination_manager = CoordinationManager::create_with_mathematical_verification()?;
//! let resource_allocator = ResourceAllocator::create_performance_optimized()?;
//! ```
//!
//! ### Hardware-Backed Security Boundary Management
//!
//! Multi-TEE applications require sophisticated boundary management that maintains security
//! isolation while enabling necessary coordination across secure execution environments.
//! AEVOR-EXECUTION provides mathematical verification of boundary enforcement that ensures
//! security guarantees remain effective even during complex cross-TEE coordination.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use aevor_execution::{
//!     privacy::{BoundaryEnforcement, PrivacyBoundaryManager, ConfidentialityProtection},
//!     multi_tee::{TeeCoordination, SecureServiceOrchestration, DistributedTeeExecution}
//! };
//!
//! // Mathematical boundary verification across multiple TEE instances
//! let boundary_manager = PrivacyBoundaryManager::create_cross_tee_enforcement()?;
//! let tee_coordination = TeeCoordination::create_with_boundary_preservation()?;
//! let distributed_execution = DistributedTeeExecution::create_secure_coordination()?;
//! ```
//!
//! ### Performance-First Multi-TEE Architecture
//!
//! Traditional distributed execution approaches create coordination overhead that limits
//! performance scaling. AEVOR-EXECUTION demonstrates how sophisticated coordination can
//! enable performance that improves with additional TEE resources rather than being
//! constrained by coordination complexity.
//!
//! ## Execution Orchestration Capabilities
//!
//! ### Application Lifecycle Management Without Policy Embedding
//!
//! AEVOR-EXECUTION maintains strict separation between infrastructure capabilities that
//! enable sophisticated execution coordination and application policies that implement
//! specific business logic. Every orchestration primitive provides coordination
//! capabilities rather than embedding specific execution approaches that would
//! constrain application development flexibility.
//!
//! ### Cross-Platform Execution Consistency
//!
//! Multi-TEE applications work identically across Intel SGX, AMD SEV, ARM TrustZone,
//! RISC-V Keystone, and AWS Nitro Enclaves while leveraging platform-specific
//! optimization that maximizes performance without creating platform dependencies
//! or compromising functional consistency across deployment environments.
//!
//! ### Mathematical Consistency Across Distributed Execution
//!
//! Applications spanning multiple TEE instances receive mathematical guarantees about
//! execution correctness and state consistency through sophisticated verification
//! that eliminates the uncertainty characterizing traditional distributed systems
//! while enabling coordination efficiency that scales with available resources.
