# BREAKDOWN.md Guideline for Rust Codebases

## Purpose
The purpose of the BREAKDOWN.md file is to provide a comprehensive, detailed overview of a Rust codebase's structure, components, and functionalities. It is intended to help developers, including AI assistants, navigate and understand the codebase more effectively.

## File Location
The BREAKDOWN.md file should be located in the root directory of the codebase.

## Sections

### 1. Introduction
- Briefly explain the purpose and functionality of the codebase.
- Provide any necessary background information or context.

### 2. File Structure
- List all the files in the codebase, grouped by their respective modules or directories.
- For each file, include:
  - File name and path
  - Brief description of its purpose
  - List of all functions defined in the file
  - Brief explanation of each function's functionality
  - Inter-dependencies with other files
  - Crates imported (both internal and external)
  - Functions called from each imported crate and their usage in the file

### 3. Modules
- List and describe all the modules in the codebase.
- For each module, include:
  - Module name and path
  - Brief description of its purpose and functionality
  - List of all sub-modules, structs, enums, and traits defined in the module
  - Important dependencies or interactions with other modules

### 4. Crate Dependencies
- List all the external crates used in the codebase.
- For each crate, include:
  - Crate name and version
  - Brief description of its purpose and usage in the codebase
  - Files and functions that depend on the crate

### 5. Configuration and Setup
- Explain how to configure and set up the codebase to run locally.
- Include any necessary environment variables, configuration files, or database setup steps.

### 6. Testing
- Describe the testing approach and any key testing frameworks or tools used.
- Explain how to run the test suite and any important test categories or conventions.

### 7. Deployment
- Explain the deployment process and any key considerations or requirements.
- Include information about the target environment, deployment tools, and CI/CD pipeline, if applicable.

### 8. Contributing
- Provide guidelines for contributing to the codebase.
- Explain any coding conventions, commit message formats, or pull request processes.

### 9. Additional Resources
- Link to any additional documentation, READMEs, or external resources that may be helpful for understanding the codebase.

## Best Practices
- Keep the BREAKDOWN.md file comprehensive yet concise, focusing on providing a complete overview of the codebase.
- Use clear, descriptive language and avoid jargon or assumptions of prior knowledge.
- Keep the file up to date as the codebase evolves.
- Use consistent formatting and structure throughout the file.
- Consider using automated tools to generate and update the BREAKDOWN.md file based on the codebase structure.
