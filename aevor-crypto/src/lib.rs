//! # AEVOR-CRYPTO: Performance-First Cryptographic Infrastructure
//!
//! This crate provides performance-optimized cryptographic primitives that eliminate the
//! computational overhead constraining traditional blockchain systems while providing
//! superior security guarantees through TEE integration and mathematical verification.
//! Rather than forcing trade-offs between security and performance, AEVOR's cryptographic
//! architecture enables both characteristics to reinforce each other through sophisticated
//! coordination of hardware-backed security and algorithmic optimization.
//!
//! ## Revolutionary Cryptographic Architecture Principles
//!
//! ### Performance Protection Strategy - Eliminating Computational Overhead
//!
//! Traditional privacy-preserving cryptography creates massive computational overhead
//! (1000x-1,000,000x) through techniques like homomorphic encryption that make privacy
//! applications impractical for real-world deployment. AEVOR's revolutionary approach
//! eliminates these techniques entirely in favor of TEE-based approaches that provide
//! superior privacy guarantees with minimal overhead (1.1x-1.3x) while enabling
//! practical adoption of sophisticated privacy applications.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use aevor_crypto::{
//!     tee_integration::attestation::{TeeAttestation, AttestationVerification},
//!     primitives::encryption::tee_encryption::TeeEncryption,
//!     privacy::zero_knowledge::snark_systems::PerformanceOptimizedSnarks
//! };
//!
//! // Superior privacy with practical performance through TEE integration
//! let tee_encryption = TeeEncryption::create_with_hardware_backing()?;
//! let attestation = TeeAttestation::generate_for_encryption_context(&tee_encryption)?;
//! let zk_proof = PerformanceOptimizedSnarks::generate_privacy_proof_efficiently(&attestation)?;
//! 
//! // Mathematical verification without computational overhead
//! assert!(attestation.provides_mathematical_certainty());
//! assert!(tee_encryption.achieves_superior_privacy_with_minimal_overhead());
//! ```
//!
//! ### Mathematical Verification Through Hardware Attestation
//!
//! AEVOR's cryptographic primitives provide mathematical certainty through TEE attestation
//! rather than computational verification overhead that constrains parallel execution.
//! Hardware-backed verification eliminates probabilistic assumptions while enabling
//! immediate finality with stronger security guarantees than traditional cryptographic
//! approaches requiring multiple confirmations or complex proof systems.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use aevor_crypto::{
//!     verification::practical_verification::{TeeVerification, ExecutionVerification},
//!     tee_integration::secure_execution::ContextIsolation,
//!     primitives::signatures::ed25519::Ed25519TeeIntegrated
//! };
//!
//! // Mathematical certainty through hardware rather than computation
//! let secure_context = ContextIsolation::create_with_mathematical_guarantees()?;
//! let signature = Ed25519TeeIntegrated::sign_with_attestation(&message, &secure_context)?;
//! let verification = TeeVerification::verify_mathematical_correctness(&signature)?;
//! 
//! assert!(verification.provides_immediate_mathematical_certainty());
//! assert!(!verification.requires_probabilistic_assumptions());
//! ```
//!
//! ### Cross-Platform Consistency with Hardware Optimization
//!
//! All cryptographic operations provide identical behavior across Intel SGX, AMD SEV,
//! ARM TrustZone, RISC-V Keystone, and AWS Nitro Enclaves while enabling platform-specific
//! optimization that maximizes performance without creating platform dependencies.
//! This consistency enables portable applications while leveraging hardware acceleration
//! for optimal efficiency on each deployment platform.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use aevor_crypto::{
//!     cross_platform::consistency::{AlgorithmConsistency, BehavioralVerification},
//!     optimization::hardware::{PlatformSpecialization, VectorOperations},
//!     tee_integration::platform_abstraction::BehavioralConsistency
//! };
//!
//! // Identical behavior with platform-specific optimization
//! let consistency = BehavioralConsistency::ensure_across_all_platforms()?;
//! let optimization = PlatformSpecialization::optimize_for_current_platform(&consistency)?;
//! let verification = BehavioralVerification::confirm_identical_results(&optimization)?;
//! 
//! assert!(verification.maintains_cross_platform_consistency());
//! assert!(optimization.enhances_performance_without_dependencies());
//! ```
//!
//! ### Anti-Snooping Protection - Infrastructure Provider Independence
//!
//! AEVOR's cryptographic infrastructure implements comprehensive anti-snooping protection
//! that ensures cryptographic operations remain confidential even when infrastructure
//! providers control the underlying hardware. This protection operates below the level
//! that infrastructure providers can observe, enabling trustless deployment on any
//! infrastructure while maintaining complete cryptographic confidentiality.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use aevor_crypto::{
//!     anti_snooping::infrastructure_protection::{MemoryProtection, ExecutionProtection},
//!     anti_snooping::platform_protection::HardwareIsolation,
//!     tee_integration::secure_execution::PerformancePreservation
//! };
//!
//! // Complete protection from infrastructure provider surveillance
//! let memory_protection = MemoryProtection::create_below_provider_level()?;
//! let execution_protection = ExecutionProtection::isolate_from_infrastructure(&memory_protection)?;
//! let hardware_isolation = HardwareIsolation::enable_complete_confidentiality(&execution_protection)?;
//! 
//! assert!(hardware_isolation.prevents_infrastructure_provider_observation());
//! assert!(execution_protection.maintains_performance_characteristics());
//! ```
//!
//! ## Architectural Boundaries and Separation of Concerns
//!
//! ### Infrastructure Capabilities vs Cryptographic Policies
//!
//! This cryptographic infrastructure maintains strict separation between providing
//! powerful cryptographic primitives and implementing specific cryptographic policies.
//! Every primitive enables unlimited innovation in cryptographic strategies while
//! maintaining infrastructure focus on performance optimization and mathematical
//! verification rather than embedding assumptions about cryptographic usage patterns.
//!
//! ### No Homomorphic Encryption - Performance Protection Enforcement
//!
//! This infrastructure explicitly excludes homomorphic encryption techniques (Paillier,
//! ElGamal, BFV, CKKS) that create computational overhead violating performance protection
//! strategy. TEE-based approaches provide superior privacy guarantees with practical
//! performance characteristics that enable real-world adoption of privacy applications
//! rather than remaining academic demonstrations with impractical computational requirements.
//!
//! ### Mathematical Precision Without Academic Formalism
//!
//! Cryptographic verification emphasizes practical mathematical precision supporting
//! blockchain operations rather than formal proof systems creating sequential bottlenecks.
//! Verification operates through architectural design and TEE attestation rather than
//! computational overhead that would constrain the parallel execution essential for
//! revolutionary throughput characteristics.
