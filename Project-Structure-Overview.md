# Project Structure Overview - Aevor Blockchain Ecosystem

## Introduction: The Aevor Revolution in Blockchain Technology

Aevor represents a fundamental paradigm shift in blockchain architecture, delivering a comprehensive Web3 infrastructure platform that resolves the blockchain trilemma while enabling entirely new categories of applications and organizational workflows. Unlike traditional blockchain systems that force binary choices between security, scalability, and decentralization, Aevor creates a sophisticated ecosystem where these properties reinforce each other through innovative architectural decisions and coordinated technological breakthroughs.

The Aevor platform demonstrates how systematic architectural thinking can create emergent capabilities that exceed what any individual component could provide independently. Through careful design of foundational primitives, sophisticated coordination mechanisms, and flexible abstraction layers, Aevor enables everything from simple smart contracts to complex enterprise applications while maintaining consistent security guarantees and performance characteristics across all use cases.

What makes Aevor particularly revolutionary is how it treats advanced capabilities like privacy, TEE-secured execution, cross-chain interoperability, and multi-network deployment not as optional features bolted onto existing infrastructure, but as fundamental architectural elements that create new possibilities for application development and organizational coordination. This approach transforms blockchain technology from a specialized tool for cryptocurrency applications into a general-purpose infrastructure platform that can serve virtually any computational or coordination requirement while providing security guarantees that traditional systems cannot match.

## Core Architectural Innovations: The Foundation of Advanced Capabilities

Understanding Aevor's capabilities requires examining the foundational architectural decisions that enable sophisticated features through composition rather than complexity. These design choices create a platform where advanced capabilities emerge naturally from the interaction between well-designed components rather than requiring specialized implementations that compromise other system properties.

### Dual-DAG Architecture: Enabling Natural Parallelism

The Dual-DAG architecture represents a fundamental breakthrough in blockchain scalability that enables natural parallelism at both transaction and block levels without compromising security or consistency guarantees. This architecture operates through two complementary directed acyclic graphs that coordinate to provide unprecedented throughput while maintaining the ordering guarantees that make blockchain systems reliable.

The micro-DAG operates at the transaction level, analyzing dependencies between individual transactions based on object access patterns rather than arbitrary sequencing. This analysis enables massive parallelism by identifying transactions that can execute simultaneously without interfering with each other. Unlike traditional blockchain systems that process transactions sequentially regardless of their independence, the micro-DAG extracts maximum parallelism from transaction workloads while preserving causal relationships that ensure correct execution.

The macro-DAG operates at the block level, enabling multiple validators to produce blocks simultaneously rather than forcing sequential block production through leader-based mechanisms. This approach eliminates the throughput bottlenecks that plague traditional blockchain systems while maintaining consensus validity through sophisticated coordination protocols. The macro-DAG enables the network to scale block production capacity by adding validators rather than requiring faster individual validators or larger blocks that compromise decentralization.

The coordination between micro-DAG and macro-DAG creates sophisticated execution patterns where fine-grained transaction parallelism aggregates into efficient block production that maintains global consistency. This coordination enables Aevor to achieve sustained throughput exceeding 200,000 transactions per second with burst capacity over 1,000,000 transactions per second while maintaining sub-second finality for most transaction types.

The dual-DAG architecture provides the foundation that enables advanced features like mixed privacy and TEE service coordination. The dependency analysis capabilities understand when transactions involve objects with different privacy characteristics or when applications span multiple TEE instances, enabling optimal coordination while maintaining security boundaries. This architectural foundation makes sophisticated features practical rather than just theoretically possible.

### Proof of Uncorruption: Enabling TEE-Secured Consensus

The Proof of Uncorruption consensus mechanism represents a fundamental innovation that shifts focus from block production ordering to execution integrity verification. This approach enables massive parallelism while providing stronger security guarantees than traditional consensus mechanisms by leveraging hardware security features that ensure execution correctness regardless of software complexity.

Proof of Uncorruption operates by requiring all transaction execution to occur within Trusted Execution Environments that provide cryptographic proof of correct execution. Validators verify these proofs rather than re-executing transactions, enabling consensus decisions about execution correctness without requiring validators to observe transaction contents. This separation between execution and validation enables privacy-preserving transactions while maintaining the consensus validity that makes blockchain systems trustworthy.

The TEE attestation framework supports multiple hardware platforms including Intel SGX, AMD SEV, ARM TrustZone, RISC-V Keystone, and AWS Nitro Enclaves, ensuring that security guarantees remain consistent regardless of underlying hardware choices. Each platform provides equivalent security properties through different mechanisms, enabling deployment flexibility while maintaining security standards.

The consensus mechanism handles mixed deployments where different validators use different TEE technologies while maintaining equivalent security guarantees. This approach prevents vendor lock-in while enabling optimization for specific deployment environments. Organizations can choose TEE technologies that align with their infrastructure requirements while participating in the same consensus network with consistent security properties.

Proof of Uncorruption enables the sophisticated TEE service ecosystem by providing the economic and security foundations that make TEE service provision sustainable. Validators earn rewards for providing TEE services while maintaining the security guarantees that consensus requires. This integration creates economic incentives for maintaining robust TEE service infrastructure while ensuring that service provision doesn't compromise consensus security.

### Security Level Accelerator: Progressive Security Guarantees

The Security Level Accelerator provides a four-tiered validation protocol that gives users unprecedented control over their security and speed trade-offs. Rather than forcing all transactions to use the same security model, this approach enables applications to choose appropriate security levels based on their specific requirements and risk tolerance.

Minimal security provides 20-50 millisecond confirmations through single validator confirmation with TEE attestation, suitable for low-value transactions and immediate user interface feedback. This security level provides subjective certainty through TEE integrity guarantees while enabling responsive user experiences that make blockchain applications practical for interactive use cases.

Basic security provides 100-200 millisecond confirmations through validation from 10-20% of validators selected through topology-aware validation solicitation. This security level balances speed and robustness against limited collusion while providing stronger guarantees than minimal security. The validator selection algorithms consider geographic distribution and network topology to maximize security while minimizing coordination overhead.

Strong security provides 500-800 millisecond confirmations through validation from more than one-third of validators, providing Byzantine fault tolerance against sophisticated attacks. This security level uses BLS threshold signatures for efficient validation proof aggregation, enabling strong security guarantees without requiring individual signature verification from large validator sets.

Full security provides traditional BFT guarantees with confirmations from more than two-thirds of validators, suitable for high-value transactions and settlement operations. This security level integrates with the macro-DAG for global consensus while maintaining the performance benefits that progressive security enables for lower-value transactions.

The Security Level Accelerator integrates with mixed privacy capabilities by maintaining consistent security guarantees regardless of transaction privacy characteristics. Private transactions receive the same security options as public transactions, ensuring that privacy choices don't compromise security guarantees. This integration enables sophisticated applications that require both privacy and strong security without forcing trade-offs between these properties.

### Object-Oriented State Model: Enabling Granular Privacy Control

The object-oriented state model provides the foundation for Aevor's sophisticated privacy capabilities by creating natural boundaries that enable granular control over information disclosure. Unlike account-based systems where all activities become linked to identities, Aevor's object model enables each object to have independent privacy policies that prevent inappropriate information correlation.

Objects carry privacy metadata that specifies what information remains confidential, what can be selectively disclosed, and under what conditions disclosure occurs. This metadata becomes part of the object definition and travels with the object throughout its lifecycle, ensuring that privacy policies remain effective even as objects interact with other system components.

The object model enables mixed privacy scenarios where individual transactions can involve objects with completely different privacy characteristics. A transaction might involve public objects for regulatory transparency, private objects for business confidentiality, and selectively disclosed objects for partner coordination, all within the same operation while maintaining appropriate privacy boundaries between different information types.

Privacy policies can specify different disclosure rules for different types of interactions. An object might allow public queries about its existence and type while keeping ownership information private and transaction history completely confidential. These granular controls enable sophisticated privacy policies that balance transparency requirements with confidentiality needs.

Objects can implement dynamic privacy policies that change based on context, timing, or governance decisions. A medical record object might remain completely private during treatment while allowing anonymized disclosure for research purposes after patient consent. A business planning object might remain private during development phases while transitioning to selective disclosure once plans are implemented and transparency benefits stakeholder relationships.

The object model's privacy capabilities integrate seamlessly with TEE execution, where private objects execute within secure enclaves that prevent observation of computation logic or intermediate states. This integration enables applications to process sensitive information while providing cryptographic proof that processing occurred correctly without revealing underlying data or business logic.

## Mixed Privacy Capabilities: Revolutionary Information Management

Aevor's mixed privacy architecture represents a fundamental advancement beyond traditional blockchain systems that force binary choices between complete transparency and complete privacy. This sophisticated approach enables granular privacy control where different types of information can have different privacy characteristics within the same application, transaction, or organizational workflow.

### Granular Privacy Control Across All System Layers

The mixed privacy architecture operates through sophisticated coordination between multiple system layers, each contributing specific capabilities that enable comprehensive privacy management without compromising system functionality or performance characteristics.

At the transaction level, mixed privacy enables individual transactions to involve objects with completely different privacy policies while maintaining security and consistency guarantees. The execution engine creates isolated computational contexts for private components while maintaining transparent processing for public components, coordinating through cryptographic commitments that preserve privacy while enabling verification of correct execution.

The blockchain layer supports mixed privacy through hybrid block structures that contain both transparent transaction data for public objects and encrypted commitments for private objects. Validators can verify the correctness of both public and private transactions through different verification mechanisms while maintaining unified consensus decisions about block validity.

The networking layer provides privacy-preserving communication patterns that protect metadata while enabling necessary coordination between applications with different privacy requirements. Network-level observations cannot compromise privacy guarantees that application-level privacy features provide, creating defense-in-depth privacy protection.

The storage layer implements encrypted state management with multiple encryption levels, enabling efficient queries across mixed privacy datasets without compromising confidentiality. Storage operations respect object privacy policies automatically, preventing inappropriate information disclosure through database access patterns or administrative operations.

### Cross-Privacy-Level Interaction Protocols

Mixed privacy capabilities require sophisticated protocols that enable meaningful interaction between objects with different privacy characteristics while maintaining security boundaries that prevent inappropriate information disclosure.

Privacy-preserving composition enables multiple private applications to interact without compromising individual privacy guarantees. A private healthcare application might coordinate with a private financial application to enable confidential medical payment processing without either application gaining inappropriate access to information outside their respective domains.

Selective disclosure mechanisms enable controlled information sharing where specific properties about private data can be proven without revealing underlying information. A user could prove they meet age requirements without revealing their birth date, or prove they have sufficient balance for a transaction without revealing their actual balance.

Cross-domain privacy interactions enable applications to share appropriate information while maintaining confidentiality for sensitive details. A supply chain application might share delivery status information with partners while keeping pricing and sourcing information confidential, enabling sophisticated business relationships that require selective information sharing rather than binary trust decisions.

Temporal privacy policies enable information to transition between privacy levels based on time, conditions, or governance decisions. Business planning information might remain completely private during development phases while transitioning to selective disclosure once plans are implemented and appropriate transparency benefits stakeholder relationships.

### Privacy-Preserving Coordination Mechanisms

The coordination mechanisms that enable mixed privacy operations demonstrate sophisticated cryptographic techniques that maintain security while enabling necessary functionality across privacy boundaries.

Zero-knowledge integration enables public verification of private operations, allowing users to prove correct execution and maintain consensus validity while keeping all sensitive information completely private. This capability ensures that privacy does not compromise the integrity guarantees that make blockchain systems trustworthy.

TEE-based coordination enables secure computation across multiple privacy levels, where private operations execute within hardware-secured environments that prevent observation while public operations maintain transparency. The coordination between different execution contexts occurs through cryptographic commitments that enable verification without disclosure.

Multi-party computation protocols enable multiple organizations to collaborate on computations involving their combined data without revealing sensitive information about individual contributions. This capability supports research, market analysis, and collaborative intelligence applications that require information aggregation while maintaining participant confidentiality.

Homomorphic encryption enables computation on encrypted data, allowing applications to process private information while maintaining confidentiality throughout the entire computation lifecycle. Results can be verified for correctness while keeping both inputs and intermediate computation states private.

Applications can specify security requirements rather than hardware dependencies, enabling deployment flexibility while maintaining consistent security properties.

### TEE Service Allocation and Resource Management

The TEE service allocation system provides sophisticated resource management that enables smart contracts to request appropriate TEE resources while maintaining separation between validator operations and service provision. This separation ensures that service activities cannot compromise consensus security while enabling sophisticated application architectures.

Smart contracts can request TEE services through simple programming interfaces that abstract the complexity of resource allocation and instance management. A contract might specify security requirements, performance characteristics, and resource constraints, allowing the infrastructure to select appropriate TEE instances while maintaining isolation between different service users.

Multi-instance coordination enables applications that span multiple TEE environments while maintaining consistency and security guarantees. An application might use separate TEE instances for different components while coordinating state updates through secure protocols that prevent information leakage between instances.

Resource allocation optimization balances service requests across available TEE-capable validators while considering factors like geographic distribution, hardware capabilities, and current utilization levels. The allocation algorithms ensure fair access to TEE resources while optimizing for performance and security characteristics.

Fault tolerance mechanisms maintain application availability even when individual TEE instances become unavailable. The system can detect instance failures and coordinate migration to healthy instances while preserving application state and security properties.

Economic integration provides sustainable business models for TEE service provision, where validators earn rewards for providing high-quality TEE services while users pay appropriate costs for secure computation resources. The economic models align incentives to ensure reliable service provision while making TEE capabilities accessible to diverse application requirements.
