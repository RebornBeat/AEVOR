## 1. Introduction

### The Blockchain Trilemma Challenge

Blockchain systems have traditionally faced fundamental limitations known as the "blockchain trilemma" – the seemingly impossible task of simultaneously achieving security, decentralization, and scalability. These constraints have forced most platforms to make trade-offs that limit their real-world utility:

- Traditional blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum prioritize security and decentralization at the expense of scalability, processing fewer than 100 transactions per second.
- Many newer platforms increase throughput by compromising on decentralization, relying on a small set of validators or semi-centralized coordinators.
- Other systems achieve high throughput through complex sharding, introducing new attack vectors and composability challenges.

Beyond the trilemma, existing systems face additional limitations:

1. **Sequential Execution**: Transactions are processed one after another, regardless of their independence.
2. **Leader-Based Block Production**: Single-leader systems create throughput bottlenecks and introduce attack vectors.
3. **Linear Chain Structure**: Traditional chain architectures force artificial sequencing of unrelated operations.
4. **Binary Security Models**: Most systems offer only a single security threshold, forcing one-size-fits-all guarantees.
5. **Limited Privacy Options**: Few systems support confidential execution while maintaining verification.

### Aevor's Revolutionary Approach

Aevor introduces a fundamentally new blockchain architecture that resolves these limitations through a novel combination of technologies:

1. **Dual-DAG Structure**: Two complementary directed acyclic graphs operating at different levels:
   - **Micro-DAG**: Maps transaction dependencies at the object level, enabling maximum parallelism.
   - **Macro-DAG**: Allows concurrent block production without leader bottlenecks.

2. **Proof of Uncorruption (PoU)**: A consensus mechanism that validates execution integrity through hardware-backed Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs).

3. **Security Level Accelerator**: A four-tiered validation protocol providing progressive security guarantees, from millisecond-level confirmations to traditional BFT finality.

4. **Transaction-Level Superposition**: Allows transactions to exist in multiple potential states until dependencies resolve, enabling speculative execution.

5. **Topology-Aware Networking**: Optimizes validation spread based on network geography and validator distribution.

These innovations work together to create a system that delivers unprecedented performance (200,000+ TPS sustained, 1,000,000+ TPS in bursts) with sub-second finality, while maintaining security and decentralization guarantees equal to or exceeding traditional systems.

Aevor's architecture enables new classes of applications requiring high throughput, low latency, and progressive security guarantees—from financial services and supply chain management to gaming and social platforms.

## 2. System Architecture Overview

Aevor's architecture consists of several interconnected components that collectively enable its revolutionary performance and security characteristics. This section provides a high-level overview of these components before examining each in detail.

### Dual-DAG Structure

At the heart of Aevor lies the Dual-DAG architecture, which operates at two complementary levels:

1. **Micro-DAG (Transaction Dependency Graph)**
   - Vertices represent individual transactions
   - Edges represent dependencies between transactions based on object access patterns
   - Enables parallel execution of non-conflicting transactions
   - Provides fine-grained concurrency while maintaining causal ordering
   - Automatically identifies execution bottlenecks and parallelism opportunities

2. **Macro-DAG (Block Reference Graph)**
   - Vertices represent blocks containing batches of micro-DAG transactions
   - Edges represent references to multiple parent blocks
   - Enables concurrent block production without leader bottlenecks
   - Maintains a consistent global state through a verified uncorrupted frontier
   - Provides resilience against network partitions and temporary forks

The Dual-DAG structure eliminates artificial sequencing of independent operations while maintaining necessary ordering guarantees for dependent transactions.

### Proof of Uncorruption Consensus

Aevor's consensus mechanism focuses on execution integrity rather than block production ordering:

- **TEE Attestations**: Transactions execute in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) that provide hardware-level isolation and integrity guarantees.
- **Attestation Verification**: Validators verify TEE attestations to ensure execution was performed correctly.
- **Corruption Detection**: The system detects corrupted execution environments through attestation verification failures.
- **Uncorrupted Frontier**: Validators maintain an uncorrupted DAG frontier representing the canonical state.
- **Frontier Advancement**: The frontier advances as new uncorrupted blocks are validated and added to the DAG.

This approach ensures that any attempt to tamper with execution is detected and rejected, maintaining the integrity of the entire system.

### Security Level Accelerator

Aevor introduces a progressive security model with four distinct levels:

1. **Minimal Security (20-50ms)**
   - Single validator confirmation with TEE attestation
   - Suitable for low-value transactions and UI feedback
   - Provides subjective certainty through TEE integrity guarantees

2. **Basic Security (100-200ms)**
   - Confirmations from 10-20% of validators
   - Selected through topology-aware validation solicitation
   - Balances speed and robustness against limited collusion

3. **Strong Security (500-800ms)**
   - Confirmations from >1/3 of validators
   - Provides Byzantine fault tolerance against limited attacks
   - Uses BLS threshold signatures for efficient validation proof

4. **Full Security (<1s)**
   - Traditional BFT guarantee with >2/3 validator confirmations
   - Suitable for high-value transactions and settlement
   - Integrated with the macro-DAG for global consensus

This tiered approach gives users unprecedented control over their security/speed trade-offs while maintaining strong guarantees at each level.

### Execution Environment

Aevor's execution environment combines several advanced techniques:

- **Hardware TEE Integration**: Intel SGX and AMD SEV support for secure, isolated execution
- **Multi-Version Concurrency Control**: Optimistic concurrency with conflict detection and rollback
- **Parallel Contract Execution**: Independent contracts execute simultaneously
- **JIT Compilation**: Hot code paths compile to native machine code
- **Speculative Execution**: Transactions execute before dependencies are fully resolved

The execution environment ensures determinism across all validators while maximizing parallelism and throughput.

### Network Layer

Aevor's network layer incorporates several optimizations:

- **Topology-Aware Validation**: Solicits validations based on network proximity
- **RDMA-Style Transport**: Ultra-low latency communication between validators
- **Predictive DAG Prefetching**: Anticipates needed data based on transaction patterns
- **Erasure-Coded Data Availability**: Efficient data distribution with verifiable availability
- **Signature Aggregation**: Compact representation of multiple validator confirmations

These network optimizations ensure that communication overhead does not become a bottleneck, even with thousands of validators.

### Together, these architectural components create a system that delivers:

- **Massive Parallelism**: Independent transactions process concurrently
- **Continuous Block Production**: No artificial timing constraints
- **Progressive Security**: Users choose their security/speed trade-off
- **Trustless Verification**: All execution is cryptographically verifiable
- **Scalable Performance**: System throughput scales with validator resources

---

## 3. Micro-DAG: Transaction-Level Parallelism

The micro-DAG forms the foundation of Aevor's approach to massive parallelism by explicitly representing transaction dependencies at the object level. This structure enables concurrent execution of non-conflicting transactions while maintaining causal ordering for dependent operations.

### Object-Dependency Graph Structure

The micro-DAG is a directed acyclic graph where:

- **Vertices** represent individual transactions
- **Edges** represent causal dependencies between transactions
- **Dependencies** are based on object access patterns:
  - Read-after-Write (RAW): Transaction B reads an object written by Transaction A
  - Write-after-Write (WAW): Transaction B writes an object previously written by Transaction A
  - Write-after-Read (WAR): Transaction B writes an object previously read by Transaction A

Every transaction explicitly declares its read and write sets during submission, allowing the system to construct the dependency graph without requiring global knowledge of all transactions.

The micro-DAG naturally exposes parallelism by revealing which transactions have no dependencies on each other. For example, transfers between different accounts create disconnected subgraphs that can execute in parallel without coordination.

### Conflict Detection and Resolution

When multiple transactions attempt to access the same objects, the system must detect and resolve potential conflicts:

1. **Static Conflict Detection**: Before execution, the system analyzes declared read/write sets to identify potential conflicts.

2. **Dynamic Conflict Detection**: During execution, the system monitors actual object access to detect undeclared conflicts.

3. **Conflict Resolution Strategies**:
   - **Optimistic Execution**: Execute transactions speculatively and roll back if conflicts are detected
   - **Pessimistic Locking**: Acquire locks on objects before execution to prevent conflicts
   - **Timestamp Ordering**: Prioritize transactions based on submission time
   - **Dependency-Aware Scheduling**: Schedule transactions to minimize conflicts

Aevor employs optimistic execution with multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) to maximize throughput while maintaining consistency.

### Parallel Execution Pathways

The micro-DAG enables several forms of parallelism:

1. **Object-Level Parallelism**: Transactions accessing different objects execute in parallel.

2. **Pipeline Parallelism**: Transaction phases (validation, execution, storage) overlap.

3. **Speculative Parallelism**: Transactions execute before dependencies are fully resolved.

4. **Data Parallelism**: Multiple instances of the same code execute with different data.

The execution engine uses a dependency-aware scheduler that:
- Analyzes the micro-DAG to identify maximal parallel execution sets
- Maintains a topological ordering of transactions to ensure causal relationships
- Dynamically adapts scheduling based on runtime dependencies
- Detects and resolves conflicts through versioned state management

### Speculative Transaction Processing

To further increase parallelism, Aevor employs speculative execution:

1. **Early Execution**: Transactions execute before their dependencies are confirmed, creating speculative states.

2. **State Versioning**: Multiple versions of objects are maintained to track potential outcomes.

3. **Dependency Tracking**: The system tracks which states depend on which transactions.

4. **Commitment or Rollback**: When dependencies finalize, speculative states either commit or roll back.

5. **Cascading Effects**: Rollbacks propagate through dependent transactions automatically.

This speculative approach allows the system to maintain high throughput even with complex dependency chains, by executing transactions in parallel and resolving conflicts as dependencies settle.

### Optimizations and Trade-offs

Aevor implements several key optimizations for the micro-DAG:

1. **Fully Viable Optimizations**:
   - **Local Caching**: Frequently accessed objects are cached in local memory
   - **Batch Processing**: Related transactions are grouped for efficient processing
   - **Dependency Prediction**: Common dependency patterns are recognized and optimized
   - **Execution Specialization**: Common transaction types follow optimized execution paths

2. **Partially Viable Optimizations**:
   - **Lookahead Execution**: Predictively execute likely transaction paths
   - **Dynamic Re-ordering**: Reorder transaction execution based on resource availability
   - **Locality-Based Scheduling**: Group transactions by data locality

3. **Less Viable Without Adaptation**:
   - **Global Execution Prediction**: Attempts to predict the entire transaction graph
   - **Static Batching**: Fixed transaction batches regardless of dependencies

The micro-DAG approach provides orders-of-magnitude improvement in transaction parallelism compared to traditional blockchain architectures, enabling Aevor's exceptional throughput while maintaining consistency guarantees.

---

## 4. Macro-DAG: Concurrent Block Production

The macro-DAG forms the second layer of Aevor's Dual-DAG architecture, enabling concurrent block production and establishing a globally consistent view of history without resorting to leader-based approaches. This structure eliminates the throughput bottlenecks present in traditional blockchain systems while providing robust fork resolution and convergence guarantees.

### Multi-Parent Block References

Unlike traditional blockchains where each block references a single parent, Aevor's blocks in the macro-DAG can reference multiple parent blocks:

- Each block contains a vector of parent block hashes (`previous_hashes`)
- Blocks include a reference height field for topological ordering
- The DAG structure allows concurrent block production without leader election
- Multiple validators can propose blocks simultaneously, referencing overlapping sets of parents
- Block references create a partially ordered set that eventually converges

This multi-parent structure eliminates the fundamental bottleneck of sequential block production while maintaining causal relationships between blocks.

### Uncorrupted Frontier Identification

The canonical state in Aevor is represented by the "uncorrupted frontier" of the macro-DAG:

1. **Frontier Definition**: The set of "tip" blocks in the DAG that have been verified as uncorrupted
2. **Uncorruption Verification**: Each block undergoes verification through the PoU mechanism
3. **Frontier Advancement**: As new uncorrupted blocks are added, the frontier advances
4. **Frontier Consensus**: Validators reach agreement on the frontier through PoU attestations
5. **State Derivation**: The current state is derived from the entire history leading to the frontier

This approach allows the system to maintain consensus on the canonical state without requiring consensus on a single chain of blocks.

### Topological Ordering Mechanisms

While the macro-DAG allows blocks to exist without a total ordering, many applications require a deterministic ordering of transactions. Aevor provides this through deterministic topological sorting:

1. **Reference Height**: Each block includes a height value representing its position in the DAG
2. **Parenthood Relationships**: Blocks must reference all tips of the current uncorrupted frontier
3. **Tiebreaking Algorithm**: When multiple blocks have the same reference height, a deterministic tiebreaking function is applied
4. **Consistently Ordered Traversal**: Given the same DAG, all validators produce the same topological ordering

This deterministic topological ordering ensures that all validators process blocks in a consistent order while still allowing concurrent block production.

### Fork Resolution and Convergence

The macro-DAG naturally handles temporary forks and ensures convergence:

1. **Fork Creation**: Network latency or partitions can cause validators to see different parts of the DAG
2. **Concurrent Development**: Multiple "branches" of the DAG can develop simultaneously
3. **Cross-References**: New blocks eventually reference blocks from multiple branches
4. **Natural Convergence**: These cross-references cause the branches to merge
5. **Corruption Detection**: Any corrupted branches are pruned through the PoU mechanism

This approach provides robust fork resolution without requiring explicit fork choice rules, as the DAG structure itself ensures convergence to a consistent global view.

### Block Production and Propagation

Aevor's block production process in the macro-DAG works as follows:

1. **Micro-DAG Batch Selection**: Validator selects a batch of transactions from the micro-DAG
2. **Parent Selection**: Validator identifies the current uncorrupted frontier blocks as parents
3. **Block Creation**: Validator creates a block referencing these parents
4. **Execution and Attestation**: Validator executes transactions in the TEE and generates attestations
5. **Block Propagation**: Block is propagated to other validators with attestations
6. **Validation**: Other validators verify the block's integrity and attestations
7. **Frontier Update**: Upon verification, validators update their view of the uncorrupted frontier

This process continues concurrently across all validators, with each validator potentially producing blocks simultaneously.

### Optimizations and Characteristics

Several optimizations enhance the macro-DAG's performance:

1. **Fully Viable Optimizations**:
   - **Parent Selection Optimization**: Intelligent selection of parents to maximize convergence
   - **Block Size Adaptation**: Dynamic adjustment of block size based on network conditions
   - **Propagation Prioritization**: Strategic block propagation to minimize latency
   - **Attestation Aggregation**: Combining multiple attestations for efficiency

2. **Partially Viable Optimizations**:
   - **Predictive Block Production**: Anticipating the future DAG structure
   - **Speculative Block References**: Referencing unconfirmed blocks speculatively

3. **Less Viable Without Adaptation**:
   - **Global DAG Optimization**: Attempts to optimize the entire global DAG structure
   - **Fixed Block Schedules**: Predetermined block production timing

The macro-DAG provides Aevor with several key advantages:

- **Throughput Scaling**: Block production throughput scales with the number of validators
- **Resilience**: The system continues functioning despite temporary network issues
- **Low Latency**: No artificial block time constraints
- **Fairness**: All validators can participate equally in block production
- **Attack Resistance**: No leader to attack or corrupt

Together with the micro-DAG, the macro-DAG structure forms a comprehensive solution to the parallelism and ordering challenges of high-performance blockchain systems.

## 5. Transaction-Level Superposition

Transaction-level superposition is a foundational concept in Aevor that allows transactions to exist in multiple potential states until their dependencies are resolved. This approach dramatically increases parallelism by enabling speculative execution while maintaining state consistency guarantees.

### State Versioning and Isolation

At the core of transaction-level superposition is a sophisticated state versioning system:

1. **Multi-Version Object Store**: Each object in Aevor maintains multiple versions
   - Original state (baseline)
   - Intermediate states (during transaction processing)
   - Speculative states (potential outcomes)
   - Finalized states (confirmed outcomes)

2. **Version Tracking**: Each state version is associated with:
   - The transaction that created it
   - A causal history of previous states
   - A security level indicating confirmation status
   - Cryptographic proofs of execution integrity

3. **Isolation Guarantees**: The versioning system ensures:
   - Serializable isolation: Equivalent to sequential execution
   - Snapshot isolation: Transactions see a consistent snapshot of state
   - Conflict detection: Write-write conflicts are identified and resolved
   - Atomic updates: All state changes within a transaction succeed or fail together

This versioning infrastructure allows Aevor to maintain ACID transaction properties despite massive parallelism.

### Speculative Execution Model

Aevor's speculative execution model works as follows:

1. **Dependency Analysis**: When a transaction enters the system, its object dependencies are analyzed to construct the micro-DAG.

2. **Speculative Execution**:
   - Transactions execute immediately against their baseline state
   - Execution occurs in TEEs to ensure integrity
   - Results are stored as speculative states
   - Multiple parallel execution paths may develop

3. **Dependency Tracking**:
   - The system tracks which transactions depend on which speculative states
   - Causal relationships form a directed graph of state transitions
   - Each speculative state maintains references to its dependencies

4. **State Collapse**:
   - As dependencies resolve, speculative states "collapse" to definite states
   - The security level of states increases as more validators confirm them
   - Eventually, all states reach full confirmation

This model allows transactions to execute and propagate results before all dependencies are fully confirmed, dramatically reducing perceived latency.

### Conflict Detection and Rollback

When conflicts arise during speculative execution, Aevor employs sophisticated detection and rollback mechanisms:

1. **Conflict Types**:
   - Write-Write Conflicts: Two transactions attempt to modify the same object
   - Read-Write Conflicts: A transaction reads an object being modified by another transaction
   - Write-Read Conflicts: A transaction writes an object read by another transaction

2. **Detection Methods**:
   - Static Detection: Analysis of declared read/write sets
   - Dynamic Detection: Runtime monitoring of actual object access
   - Validator Cross-Verification: Comparison of execution results across validators

3. **Resolution Strategies**:
   - Deterministic Ordering: Conflicts resolved based on transaction timestamps
   - Dependency-Based Prioritization: Transactions with fewer dependencies prioritized
   - Validator-Weighted Resolution: Higher-stake validators' results given priority
   - Consensus-Based Resolution: Validators vote on conflict resolution

4. **Rollback Mechanism**:
   - Atomic Rollback: All state changes within a transaction are reversed
   - Cascading Rollback: Dependent transactions also roll back
   - Notification System: Clients are informed of transaction failures
   - Replay Strategy: Failed transactions can be automatically retried with updated dependencies

This robust conflict management ensures consistency despite highly parallel execution.

### Early Commitment Optimization

A key optimization in Aevor is early commitment, which allows independent transaction paths to finalize without waiting for the entire DAG:

1. **Independence Detection**: The system identifies transaction subgraphs with no external dependencies.

2. **Security Level Propagation**: Independent subgraphs can progress through security levels separately.

3. **Partial Graph Commitment**: Sections of the micro-DAG can be fully committed while others remain speculative.

4. **Pruning**: Committed subgraphs are pruned from the active DAG to reduce processing overhead.

5. **State Finalization**: Objects affected only by committed transactions have their state finalized.

This optimization dramatically reduces latency for independent transaction sets, which form the majority in most blockchain workloads.

### Practical Implementation and Guarantees

Aevor's transaction-level superposition is implemented through several key components:

1. **Object Versioning System**: Tracks multiple states for each object with efficient access patterns.

2. **Dependency Tracker**: Maintains the micro-DAG structure and propagates state changes.

3. **TEE Execution Environment**: Provides isolated, verifiable execution for transactions.

4. **Validation Network**: Distributes and verifies speculative states across validators.

5. **Commitment Manager**: Handles state finalization as security levels increase.

This implementation provides several crucial guarantees:

- **Consistency**: The system never commits inconsistent states.
- **Liveness**: Transactions eventually either commit or roll back.
- **Integrity**: All state transitions are cryptographically verifiable.
- **Determinism**: Given the same inputs, all validators produce identical state transitions.
- **Performance**: The system maximizes parallelism while maintaining these guarantees.

Transaction-level superposition represents a fundamental advancement over traditional blockchain execution models, enabling Aevor's unprecedented combination of throughput, latency, and security.

## 6. Proof of Uncorruption Consensus

Proof of Uncorruption (PoU) is Aevor's novel consensus mechanism that shifts focus from block production ordering to execution integrity verification. This approach ensures that all transactions are executed correctly while enabling massive parallelism and eliminating many traditional consensus bottlenecks.

### TEE Attestation Framework

At the core of PoU is Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) attestation:

1. **Hardware Security Enclaves**: Aevor utilizes TEEs such as Intel SGX and AMD SEV to create isolated execution environments that protect code and data integrity.

2. **Remote Attestation Protocol**: TEEs generate cryptographic proofs that:
   - The correct code is running unmodified
   - Execution occurred in a genuine TEE
   - Memory was protected during execution
   - Results were not tampered with

3. **Attestation Contents**:
   - Transaction inputs and parameters
   - Complete execution trace
   - Initial and final state root hashes
   - Object read/write sets
   - Timestamp and execution metadata
   - TEE hardware measurements

4. **Verification Process**:
   - Attestations are verified cryptographically by other validators
   - Hardware signatures are checked against manufacturer certificates
   - Execution determinism is verified by comparing attestations
   - State transitions are validated against consensus rules

This framework ensures that transaction execution occurs correctly and that results cannot be tampered with, even by the validator operating the TEE.

### Corruption Detection Mechanisms

PoU includes sophisticated mechanisms to detect any attempt to corrupt the execution environment:

1. **Attestation Cross-Verification**: Validators compare their TEE attestations to detect discrepancies.

2. **Hardware Integrity Checks**: TEEs perform continuous self-checks to detect tampering attempts.

3. **Execution Determinism Verification**: Given identical inputs, all TEEs must produce identical outputs.

4. **Side-Channel Monitoring**: The system includes protections against side-channel attacks on TEEs.

5. **Corruption Patterns Analysis**: Machine learning algorithms detect patterns indicative of compromise attempts.

When corruption is detected, the system employs several response mechanisms:

- Immediate block rejection
- Validator flagging and potential slashing
- Execution environment quarantine
- Corrupted path pruning from the DAG
- Security alert propagation to the network

### Uncorrupted History Verification

PoU maintains a continuously verified history of uncorrupted execution:

1. **Integrity Chain**: Each block contains attestations that cryptographically verify:
   - The integrity of its own execution
   - The integrity of all parent blocks it references
   - The validity of state transitions

2. **Macro-DAG Attestation**: The macro-DAG structure is augmented with:
   - Block-level TEE attestations
   - Aggregated validation signatures
   - Hierarchical integrity proofs
   - Security level indicators

3. **Verification Process**:
   - New validators can verify the entire history independently
   - Incremental verification allows efficient syncing
   - Proofs are compact and verification is parallelizable
   - Zero-knowledge proofs enable efficient light client verification

This approach ensures that the entire execution history is verifiably uncorrupted while enabling efficient verification.

### Chain Pruning and Recovery

When corruption is detected, PoU employs robust recovery mechanisms:

1. **Localized Pruning**: Only the corrupted branches of the DAG are pruned, preserving valid execution paths.

2. **Corruption Boundary Identification**: The system precisely identifies where corruption begins.

3. **State Rollback**: Objects affected by corrupted execution rollback to their last valid state.

4. **Recovery Execution**: Valid transactions are re-executed from the uncorrupted state.

5. **Validator Accountability**: Validators responsible for corruption face slashing penalties.

This recovery process ensures that the system quickly returns to a valid state after detecting corruption, with minimal impact on throughput and latency.

### Integration with Security Level Acceleration

PoU works seamlessly with the Security Level Accelerator to provide progressive security guarantees:

1. **Minimal Security**: Initial TEE attestation provides basic integrity guarantees.

2. **Basic Security**: Multiple validator attestations confirm execution integrity.

3. **Strong Security**: A threshold of validator attestations ensures Byzantine fault tolerance.

4. **Full Security**: Supermajority attestation provides traditional BFT guarantees.

At each level, the uncorruption proofs accumulate, providing increasingly stronger guarantees about execution integrity.

### Advantages Over Traditional Consensus

PoU offers several key advantages compared to traditional consensus mechanisms:

1. **Execution Focus**: PoU focuses on execution integrity rather than block ordering, aligning with the actual security needs of blockchain systems.

2. **Parallelism**: By separating execution verification from block production, PoU enables massive parallelism.

3. **Efficiency**: TEE attestations are compact and can be aggregated, reducing network overhead.

4. **Determinism**: PoU provides deterministic finality rather than probabilistic guarantees.

5. **Privacy Compatibility**: TEEs enable private execution while maintaining verifiability.

6. **Progressive Security**: PoU integrates naturally with tiered security levels, giving users control over security/speed trade-offs.

This novel approach to consensus resolves many limitations of traditional mechanisms while providing stronger security guarantees and enabling Aevor's exceptional performance characteristics.

## 7. Security Level Accelerator

The Security Level Accelerator is Aevor's innovative protocol for providing tiered security guarantees with optimized validation collection. This system gives users unprecedented control over their security/speed trade-offs while maintaining strong guarantees at each level.

### Security Levels Overview

Aevor provides four distinct security levels, each with different characteristics and use cases:

1. **Minimal Security (20-50ms)**
   - **Validators**: Single validator with TEE attestation
   - **Protection Against**: Individual validator faults
   - **Guarantees**: TEE integrity verification, cryptographic proof of execution
   - **Use Cases**: UI feedback, low-value microtransactions, temporary state changes
   - **Technical Implementation**: Direct TEE attestation with local validation

2. **Basic Security (100-200ms)**
   - **Validators**: 10-20% of active validator set
   - **Protection Against**: Small-scale collusion, limited TEE compromises
   - **Guarantees**: Strong probabilistic security with distributed validation
   - **Use Cases**: Standard transactions, everyday payments, token transfers
   - **Technical Implementation**: Topology-aware validation solicitation with BLS aggregation

3. **Strong Security (500-800ms)**
   - **Validators**: >1/3 of active validator set
   - **Protection Against**: Byzantine attacks up to 1/3 threshold
   - **Guarantees**: Traditional BFT safety threshold
   - **Use Cases**: High-value transfers, important state changes, contract deployments
   - **Technical Implementation**: Threshold BLS signatures with cross-region validation

4. **Full Security (<1s)**
   - **Validators**: >2/3 of active validator set
   - **Protection Against**: Maximum possible Byzantine attacks
   - **Guarantees**: Traditional BFT liveness and safety guarantee
   - **Use Cases**: Settlement, cross-chain operations, critical state changes
   - **Technical Implementation**: Supermajority BLS aggregation with DAG inclusion

These security levels provide a continuous spectrum from rapid confirmation to maximum security, allowing applications and users to choose appropriate guarantees for each operation.

### Minimal Security Implementation

The Minimal Security level provides near-instant feedback through a single validator's TEE attestation:

1. **Transaction Submission**:
   - Client submits transaction to nearest validator
   - Validator performs basic validation checks

2. **TEE Execution**:
   - Transaction executes inside validator's TEE
   - TEE generates cryptographic attestation of execution

3. **Attestation Verification**:
   - Validator verifies TEE attestation internally
   - Client receives attestation proof for verification

4. **Client Verification**:
   - Client verifies attestation cryptographically
   - Transaction enters subjective confirmed state

This process typically completes in 20-50ms, providing immediate feedback while ensuring execution integrity through hardware attestation.

### Basic Security Implementation

The Basic Security level provides robust validation through a strategic subset of validators:

1. **Topology-Aware Validation Selection**:
   - System selects 10-20% of validators based on:
     - Network proximity (to minimize latency)
     - Stake distribution (for economic security)
     - Geographic diversity (for fault tolerance)
     - Past validation performance (for reliability)
