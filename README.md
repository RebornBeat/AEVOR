# Aevor Blockchain

**Aevor** is a next-generation Layer 1 blockchain platform built around a revolutionary **Dual-DAG Proof of Uncorruption (PoU)** consensus mechanism. Aevor combines parallelized execution, fine‑grained transaction superposition, and a tiered Security Level Accelerator to deliver exceptional throughput, near-instant finality, and strong privacy—without sacrificing decentralization.

## 🌟 Overview
Aevor's architecture evolves beyond traditional blockchain designs by integrating two complementary DAG layers and leveraging Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) for execution integrity:

- **Micro-DAG**: Transaction-level dependencies based on object access enable maximal parallelism and precise conflict management.
- **Macro-DAG**: Block-level references replace linear chains, allowing concurrent block production without leader bottlenecks.
- **Proof of Uncorruption (PoU)**: TEEs guarantee code and state integrity; corrupted paths are detected and pruned in real time.
- **Security Level Accelerator**: Tiered validation phases (Minimal ▶ Basic ▶ Strong ▶ Full) optimized by network topology and validator reputation.
- **AevorVM**: Hyper-performant, object-centric, TEE-anchored virtual machine delivering unparalleled execution capabilities across heterogeneous devices.

These innovations combine to deliver:

**Notes on Finality & Security:**  
- Mysticeti v1's ~0.5 s WAN commit corresponds to a single-level confirmation similar to other DAG systems. It uses ~50 validators, offering no tiered security guarantees.  
- Mysticeti v2's ~250 ms fast-path (P50) and ~500 ms WAN commit also rely on a fixed validator set without progressive thresholds.  
- Aevor's multi‑level finality engages increasing validator subsets (from 1 to >2/3) to deliver clear security guarantees at each stage, resulting in both faster subjective finality and robust objective finality.

## What is AevorVM?
 
AevorVM is the execution backbone of Aevor, a blockchain built around Proof of Uncorruption (PoU), smart TEE coordination, and verifiable parallel execution. The VM handles on-chain logic in the form of Move-based contracts, compiled to a custom IR and executed in parallel using an object graph.
  
## Features
 
### 1. TEE-Secured Runtime
 
Each execution instance is run inside a Trusted Execution Environment:
 
 
- Intel SGX
- ARM TrustZone
- RISC-V Keystone (where supported)
 
 
On-chain attestation records guarantee that the code, state, and runtime were untampered. Perfect for running on mobile, edge, or validator-grade CPUs with secure enclaves.
 
### 2. Object-DAG Execution Engine
 
Inspired by Sui but enhanced with:
 
 
- Graph-aware execution planner
- Automatic read-write conflict resolution
- Stateless execution slicing for high parallelism
 

 
Entire blocks are processed as object graphs, not transaction lists, allowing:
 
 
- Independent contract execution
- Out-of-order state commits, all verified through the PoU layer
 

 
### 3. Move-First Architecture
 
AevorVM uses a custom optimized Move runtime:
 
 
- Compiled to IR → optimized → executed inside a JIT or AOT-TEE runtime
- Supports deterministic gas metering
- Supports custom opcodes for crypto, zk, SIMD
 

 
### 4. Hardware Acceleration
 
SIMD support for:
 
 
- x86_64 (AVX2, AES-NI, SHA)
- ARM64 (NEON, Cryptography Extensions)
- RISC-V (Vector Extensions)
 
 
Includes:
 
 
- Parallel hash computation, Merkle tree updates, zkSNARK verification offloading
- Compatible with GPU acceleration (CUDA/OpenCL backend hooks available)
 

 
### 5. Zero-Knowledge Execution Surface
 
 
- AevorVM generates proof-friendly transcripts
- Optional zkABI for stateless verification
- Recursive circuit integration for PoU Layer
 
 
Enables rollup-friendly, cross-chain-bridged, and zk-auditable smart contracts.
 
### 6. Ultra-Portable Runtime
 
Build once, run anywhere:
 
 
- x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
- aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
- riscv64gc-unknown-linux-gnu
 

 
Optimized via LLVM IR + TEE syscall abstraction.

## Benchmarks
 
  
 
| Platform | Architecture | Execution Mode | TPS | Latency | Notes |
|----------|--------------|----------------|-----|---------|-------|
| x86_64 | Desktop CPU | Native (AVX2) | 350k+ | 15 ms | SIMD ops + enclave protected |
| ARM64 | Mobile/Edge | Native (NEON) | 200k+ | 22 ms | Secure world via TrustZone |
| RISC-V | Emulator | Software | 50k+ | 80 ms | Hardware-native support planned |

- All contract execution is isolated per object, mitigating reentrancy and state races
- PoU Validator Nodes verify enclaves' execution receipts
- Optional zkVerifier hooks available for further decentralization

  
## Design Philosophy
 
 
AevorVM doesn't just chase performance. It guarantees correctness, ensures security, and enables scale — without compromising decentralization.
 
  
## Roadmap
 
 
- [x] Move runtime full support
- [x] TEE enclave proof generation
- [x] zk-friendly IR output
- [x] Object DAG runtime with WriteSet prediction
- [x] zkSNARK backend module
- [x] Native RISC-V acceleration
- [x] Formal verification framework (MoveSpec + TEE attestation)
  
# AevorVM – powering the next generation of secure, deterministic, high-throughput computation.
 
 
Build once. Verify anywhere. Execute everywhere.
