# Aevor Blockchain


**Aevor** is a next-generation Layer¬†1 blockchain platform built around a revolutionary **Dual-DAG Proof of Uncorruption (PoU)** consensus mechanism. Aevor combines parallelized execution, fine‚Äëgrained transaction superposition, and a tiered Security Level Accelerator to deliver exceptional throughput, near-instant finality, and strong privacy‚Äîwithout sacrificing decentralization.

## üåü Overview
Aevor‚Äôs architecture evolves beyond traditional blockchain designs by integrating two complementary DAG layers and leveraging Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) for execution integrity:

- **Micro-DAG**: Transaction-level dependencies based on object access enable maximal parallelism and precise conflict management.
- **Macro-DAG**: Block-level references replace linear chains, allowing concurrent block production without leader bottlenecks.
- **Proof of Uncorruption (PoU)**: TEEs guarantee code and state integrity; corrupted paths are detected and pruned in real time.
- **Security Level Accelerator**: Tiered validation phases (Minimal ‚ñ∂ Basic ‚ñ∂ Strong ‚ñ∂ Full) optimized by network topology and validator reputation.

These innovations combine to deliver:

## üöÄ Key Features

### üõ°Ô∏è Dual-DAG PoU Consensus
- **Micro-DAG Transaction Dependencies**: Object‚Äëcentric transaction DAG for parallel execution.
- **Macro-DAG Block Structure**: Blocks reference multiple parents; concurrent block creation.
- **TEE Integrity & Corruption Monitoring**: Hardware-backed attestations; real-time validation of execution environments.

### üîí Private & Confidential Execution
- **TEE-based Contract Execution**: Encrypted smart contracts with privacy preservation.
- **Optional ZK Proofs**: Zero-knowledge proofs for selective transparency.

### ‚ö° Security Level Accelerator
- **Minimal Security**: Single validator confirmation (~20‚Äì50‚ÄØms)
- **Basic Security**: 10‚Äì20% validator confirmations (~100‚Äì200‚ÄØms)
- **Strong Security**: >1/3 validator confirmations (~500‚Äì800‚ÄØms)
- **Full Security**: >2/3 validator confirmations (<‚ÄØ1‚ÄØs)
- **BLS Signature Aggregation**: Compact multi‚Äëvalidator proofs reduce network overhead.
- **Topology-Aware Solicitation**: Prioritized requests to nearest validators for speed.

### üåê V1 Enhancements
The initial release (V1) further integrates:
- **Hybrid Topology Mesh**: RDMA‚Äëstyle transports for sub‚Äë5‚ÄØms propagation.
- **zk-SNARK Checkpoints**: Succinct proofs of macro‚ÄëDAG state for instant light‚Äëclient sync.
- **Predictive DAG Prefetching**: Warm micro-DAG caches based on incoming cluster forecasts.

These enhancements **reduce end-to-end latency by 10‚Äì20%** under load (e.g., micro-DAG inclusion and propagation) but do **not** increase peak throughput.

### üèóÔ∏è V2 Roadmap (Experimental)
- **Dynamic Micro‚ÄëDAG Sharding**: Partition DAG by object neighborhoods for hotspot isolation.
- **Off‚ÄëChain Channels**: Fast‚Äëpath state channels with on‚Äëchain commits of final deltas.

> **Note:** V2 features are experimental; benchmarks to follow in Q3/Q4¬†2025.

**Notes on Finality & Security:**  
- Mysticeti¬†v1‚Äôs ~0.5‚ÄØs WAN commit corresponds to a single-level confirmation similar to other DAG systems. It uses ~50 validators, offering no tiered security guarantees.  
- Mysticeti¬†v2‚Äôs ~250‚ÄØms fast-path (P50) and ~500‚ÄØms WAN commit also rely on a fixed validator set without progressive thresholds.  
- Aevor‚Äôs multi‚Äëlevel finality engages increasing validator subsets (from 1 to >2/3) to deliver clear security guarantees at each stage, resulting in both faster subjective finality and robust objective finality.

## What is AevorVM?
 
AevorVM is the execution backbone of Aevor, a blockchain built around Proof of Uncorruption (PoU), smart TEE coordination, and verifiable parallel execution. The VM handles on-chain logic in the form of Move-based contracts, compiled to a custom IR and executed in parallel using an object graph.
  
## Features
 
### 1. TEE-Secured Runtime
 
Each execution instance is run inside a Trusted Execution Environment:
 
 
- Intel SGX
 
- ARM TrustZone
 
- RISC-V Keystone (where supported)
 
 
On-chain attestation records guarantee that the code, state, and runtime were untampered. Perfect for running on mobile, edge, or validator-grade CPUs with secure enclaves.
 
### 2. Object-DAG Execution Engine
 
Inspired by Sui but enhanced with:
 
 
- Graph-aware execution planner
 
- Automatic read-write conflict resolution
 
- Stateless execution slicing for high parallelism
 

 
Entire blocks are processed as object graphs, not transaction lists, allowing:
 
 
- Independent contract execution
 
- Out-of-order state commits, all verified through the PoU layer
 

 
### 3. Move-First Architecture
 
AevorVM uses a custom optimized Move runtime:
 
 
- Compiled to IR ‚Üí optimized ‚Üí executed inside a JIT or AOT-TEE runtime
 
- Supports deterministic gas metering
 
- Supports custom opcodes for crypto, zk, SIMD
 

 
### 4. Hardware Acceleration
 
SIMD support for:
 
 
- x86_64 (AVX2, AES-NI, SHA)
 
- ARM64 (NEON, Cryptography Extensions)
 
- RISC-V (Vector Extensions)
 
 
Includes:
 
 
- Parallel hash computation, Merkle tree updates, zkSNARK verification offloading
 
- Compatible with GPU acceleration (CUDA/OpenCL backend hooks available)
 

 
### 5. Zero-Knowledge Execution Surface
 
 
- AevorVM generates proof-friendly transcripts
 
- Optional zkABI for stateless verification
 
- Recursive circuit integration for PoU Layer
 
 
Enables rollup-friendly, cross-chain-bridged, and zk-auditable smart contracts.
 
### 6. Ultra-Portable Runtime
 
Build once, run anywhere:
 
 
- x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
 
- aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
 
- riscv64gc-unknown-linux-gnu
 

 
Optimized via LLVM IR + TEE syscall abstraction.

## Design Philosophy
 
 
AevorVM doesn‚Äôt just chase performance. It guarantees correctness, ensures security, and enables scale ‚Äî without compromising decentralization.
 
  
## Roadmap
 
 
- [x] Move runtime full support
 
- [x] TEE enclave proof generation
 
- [x] zk-friendly IR output
 
- [x] Object DAG runtime with WriteSet prediction
 
- [ ] zkSNARK backend module
 
- [ ] Native RISC-V acceleration
 
- [ ] Formal verification framework (MoveSpec + TEE attestation)
 
  
# AevorVM ‚Äì powering the next generation of secure, deterministic, high-throughput computation.
 
 
Build once. Verify anywhere. Execute everywhere.
