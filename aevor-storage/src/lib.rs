//! # AEVOR-STORAGE: Revolutionary Blockchain State Management Infrastructure
//!
//! This crate provides encrypted state management for core blockchain infrastructure that
//! demonstrates genuine blockchain trilemma transcendence through sophisticated coordination
//! of mathematical consistency, privacy preservation, and performance optimization. AEVOR-STORAGE
//! maintains complete separation between core blockchain state management and application
//! storage services while enabling distributed coordination that scales with network resources.
//!
//! ## Revolutionary Storage Architecture
//!
//! ### Mathematical State Consistency Without Verification Overhead
//!
//! AEVOR-STORAGE achieves mathematical consistency guarantees through sophisticated coordination
//! that eliminates the verification overhead constraining traditional blockchain storage systems.
//! State transitions operate through mathematical verification of correctness while maintaining
//! performance characteristics that enable parallel execution and revolutionary throughput.
//!
//! Traditional blockchain storage systems force trade-offs between consistency guarantees and
//! performance characteristics, requiring complex verification systems that create coordination
//! bottlenecks. AEVOR's storage architecture demonstrates how mathematical precision through
//! TEE attestation and logical ordering can provide stronger consistency guarantees while
//! enabling better performance through parallel state management and distributed coordination.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use aevor_storage::{
//!     core::state_management::{StateStore, StateTransitions, ConsistencyGuarantee},
//!     privacy::encryption::{TeeEncryption, MultiLevelEncryption},
//!     tee_storage::secure_storage::{EnclaveStorage, VerifiedStorage},
//!     frontier_storage::frontier_tracking::ProgressionTracking
//! };
//!
//! // Mathematical consistency through TEE coordination
//! let state_store = StateStore::create_with_mathematical_guarantees()?;
//! let tee_encryption = TeeEncryption::create_with_hardware_security()?;
//! let secure_storage = EnclaveStorage::create_with_attestation_verification()?;
//! let frontier_tracking = ProgressionTracking::create_with_uncorrupted_verification()?;
//! ```
//!
//! ### Privacy-Preserving State Management with Performance Optimization
//!
//! Storage privacy operates through hardware-backed encryption and confidentiality mechanisms
//! that provide superior privacy guarantees with minimal computational overhead compared to
//! traditional cryptographic approaches. Multi-level encryption enables granular privacy
//! control while maintaining performance characteristics that support revolutionary throughput.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use aevor_storage::{
//!     privacy::confidentiality::{DataClassification, SelectiveEncryption},
//!     privacy::access_control::{PermissionManagement, PrivacyAwareAccess},
//!     privacy::selective_disclosure::{PolicyEnforcement, ConditionalDisclosure}
//! };
//!
//! // Hardware-backed privacy with practical performance
//! let data_classification = DataClassification::create_with_privacy_levels()?;
//! let selective_encryption = SelectiveEncryption::create_with_tee_coordination()?;
//! let privacy_access = PrivacyAwareAccess::create_with_mathematical_verification()?;
//! ```
//!
//! ### TEE-Secured Distributed Storage Coordination
//!
//! TEE-integrated storage provides hardware-backed security guarantees across multiple
//! secure execution environments while maintaining behavioral consistency and coordination
//! efficiency. Multi-instance coordination enables applications to leverage distributed
//! secure storage while maintaining mathematical consistency and security boundaries.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use aevor_storage::{
//!     tee_storage::multi_instance::{StateSynchronization, CoordinationProtocols},
//!     tee_storage::platform_abstraction::{CrossPlatformStorage, BehavioralConsistency},
//!     distribution::geographic::{GlobalDistribution, RegionalCoordination}
//! };
//!
//! // Cross-platform TEE storage with distributed coordination
//! let state_sync = StateSynchronization::create_with_distributed_consistency()?;
//! let cross_platform = CrossPlatformStorage::create_with_behavioral_verification()?;
//! let global_distribution = GlobalDistribution::create_with_performance_optimization()?;
//! ```
//!
//! ## Architectural Boundaries and Infrastructure Focus
//!
//! ### Core Blockchain Storage Separation from Application Storage
//!
//! AEVOR-STORAGE maintains strict separation between core blockchain state management
//! and application storage services, ensuring that infrastructure remains focused on
//! revolutionary blockchain capabilities while enabling unlimited application innovation
//! through sophisticated storage primitives that provide mathematical consistency and
//! privacy coordination without implementing application-specific storage policies.
//!
//! ### Revolutionary Capability Enablement Through Storage Primitives
//!
//! Storage infrastructure enables applications requiring trustless operation, mathematical
//! verification of state consistency, and sophisticated privacy coordination that wasn't
//! previously possible with blockchain technology. The uncorrupted frontier storage
//! demonstrates how mathematical verification can provide stronger guarantees than
//! traditional blockchain state management while enabling performance characteristics
//! that make sophisticated applications practical for real-world deployment.
//!
//! ### Performance Protection Through Efficient Coordination
//!
//! Every storage operation enhances rather than constrains revolutionary throughput by
//! eliminating coordination overhead, reducing verification complexity, and enabling
//! parallel state management that scales with network resources rather than creating
//! bottlenecks that limit the dual-DAG parallel execution advantages.
