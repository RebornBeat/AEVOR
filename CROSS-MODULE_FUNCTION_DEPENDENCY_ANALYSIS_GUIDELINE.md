# Cross-Module Function Dependency Analysis Guideline

## Purpose
The purpose of the Cross-Module Function Dependency Analysis is to identify and document the dependencies between functions across different modules in the codebase. This analysis helps in understanding the interconnectivity of modules and can aid in refactoring, testing, and maintaining the codebase.

## Structure
1. Module-level Function Dependencies:
   - For each module, identify the functions that are used by or depend on functions from other modules.
   - List the functions along with the modules and specific functions they depend on.

2. Function Usage:
   - For each function, indicate the modules and files where it is used or called.
   - Use the format: `module::file::function`.

3. Dependency Direction:
   - Clearly indicate the direction of the dependency.
   - Use the format: `Function A` is used in `Module B`.

4. Consistency:
   - Ensure that the function names and module names are consistent throughout the analysis.
   - Verify that the listed dependencies accurately reflect the actual usage in the codebase.

5. Completeness:
   - Aim to cover all the significant cross-module function dependencies.
   - Include dependencies from all relevant modules and files.

## Best Practices
- Keep the analysis up to date with the codebase.
- Use a consistent and clear format for representing dependencies.
- Regularly review and update the analysis as the codebase evolves.
- Use tools or scripts to automate the generation of the dependency analysis, if possible.
- Collaborate with team members to ensure accuracy and completeness of the analysis.

## Benefits
- Helps in understanding the relationships and dependencies between modules.
- Identifies potential areas for refactoring and improving modularity.
- Facilitates testing by highlighting the dependencies that need to be considered.
- Assists in impact analysis when making changes to specific functions or modules.
- Serves as documentation for developers to understand the interconnectivity of the codebase.
