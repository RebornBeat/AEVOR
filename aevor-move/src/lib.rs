//! # AEVOR-MOVE: Revolutionary Smart Contract Programming
//!
//! This crate provides comprehensive Move language integration with AEVOR's revolutionary
//! blockchain infrastructure, enabling smart contracts to access TEE services, privacy
//! capabilities, mathematical verification, and sophisticated coordination features through
//! elegant programming interfaces that maintain Move's safety guarantees while providing
//! access to capabilities impossible with traditional blockchain technology.
//!
//! ## Revolutionary Move Programming Capabilities
//!
//! ### TEE-Enhanced Smart Contract Execution
//! 
//! AEVOR-MOVE enables Move smart contracts to leverage TEE services for confidential
//! computation, secure multi-party operations, and privacy-preserving business logic
//! while maintaining Move's resource safety and mathematical verification guarantees.
//! Contracts can request TEE allocation, execute confidential computations, and coordinate
//! across multiple secure execution environments through intuitive Move programming patterns.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use aevor_move::tee_integration::{TeeServiceRequest, ConfidentialExecution};
//! use aevor_move::privacy::{PrivateContract, SelectiveDisclosure};
//! 
//! // TEE-enhanced Move contract with privacy guarantees
//! let tee_service = TeeServiceRequest::allocate_secure_execution()?;
//! let private_contract = PrivateContract::deploy_with_tee_integration(contract_bytecode, tee_service)?;
//! let confidential_result = private_contract.execute_confidential_function(input_data)?;
//! ```
//!
//! ### Mixed Privacy Programming Patterns
//!
//! Move contracts can implement sophisticated privacy models where different objects
//! and operations have granular privacy characteristics. Applications can handle public
//! regulatory compliance alongside private business logic, implement selective disclosure
//! for audit trails, and coordinate across privacy boundaries while maintaining
//! mathematical verification of correctness throughout all privacy levels.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use aevor_move::privacy::{MixedPrivacyContract, PrivacyPolicy, BoundaryManagement};
//! 
//! // Mixed privacy Move contract with granular control
//! let privacy_policy = PrivacyPolicy::create_mixed_privacy()
//!     .public_compliance_data()
//!     .private_business_logic()
//!     .selective_disclosure_audit_trail()?;
//! 
//! let mixed_contract = MixedPrivacyContract::deploy(contract_bytecode, privacy_policy)?;
//! ```
//!
//! ### Mathematical Verification Integration
//!
//! Move contracts benefit from AEVOR's mathematical verification capabilities including
//! formal verification integration, runtime correctness checking, and property-based
//! validation that provides mathematical certainty about contract behavior rather than
//! probabilistic testing approaches that can miss edge cases or security vulnerabilities.
//!
//! ## Architecture Integration with AEVOR Infrastructure
//!
//! ### Language Integration Without Development Environment Implementation
//!
//! AEVOR-MOVE maintains strict focus on Move language integration with revolutionary
//! infrastructure primitives rather than implementing comprehensive development environments
//! that belong in external ecosystem projects. This separation enables rapid innovation
//! in Move tooling while ensuring infrastructure remains focused on providing revolutionary
//! capabilities that enable applications impossible with traditional blockchain systems.
//!
//! ### Cross-Platform Consistency with Hardware Optimization
//!
//! Move contracts execute consistently across Intel SGX, AMD SEV, ARM TrustZone,
//! RISC-V Keystone, and AWS Nitro Enclaves while leveraging platform-specific optimization
//! for enhanced performance characteristics. The behavioral consistency ensures that
//! Move contract deployment decisions can be based on operational requirements rather
//! than platform-specific functionality limitations or performance variations.
//!
//! ### Performance-First Move Execution
//!
//! The Move integration optimizes execution performance through hardware acceleration,
//! parallel compilation, and intelligent resource management while maintaining Move's
//! safety guarantees and mathematical precision. Optimization strategies enable Move
//! contracts to achieve performance characteristics approaching native execution while
//! benefiting from blockchain security, decentralization, and mathematical verification.
