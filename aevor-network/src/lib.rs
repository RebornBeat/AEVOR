//! # AEVOR-NETWORK: Privacy-Preserving Global Coordination Infrastructure
//!
//! This crate provides comprehensive networking infrastructure that enables AEVOR's revolutionary
//! blockchain architecture to achieve global coordination efficiency while maintaining complete
//! privacy protection for network topology, communication patterns, and user activities. Rather
//! than forcing traditional trade-offs between performance and privacy, this networking
//! infrastructure demonstrates how sophisticated coordination can provide CDN-like performance
//! characteristics while maintaining stronger privacy guarantees than any previous blockchain
//! networking system.
//!
//! ## Revolutionary Networking Architecture Principles
//!
//! ### Privacy-Preserving Global Coordination
//! 
//! Traditional blockchain networks often provide strong transaction privacy while inadvertently
//! revealing significant information through network communication patterns, validator relationships,
//! and operational metadata that can be analyzed to infer sensitive information about blockchain
//! participants and activities. AEVOR's networking architecture demonstrates how advanced
//! cryptographic techniques and sophisticated coordination can provide comprehensive privacy
//! protection that extends beyond transaction content to encompass all aspects of network operation.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use aevor_network::{
//!     privacy::{
//!         PrivacyPreservingCommunication, TopologyPrivacy, MetadataProtection,
//!         AntiSnoopingProtection, SurveillanceResistance
//!     },
//!     routing::{
//!         IntelligentRouting, PrivacyPreservingRouting, LatencyOptimization,
//!         TopologyAwareRouting, GeographicOptimization
//!     },
//!     performance::{
//!         NetworkPerformanceOptimization, CdnLikePerformance, GlobalCoordination,
//!         ThroughputOptimization, LatencyMinimization
//!     }
//! };
//!
//! // Revolutionary networking that enhances privacy and performance together
//! let privacy_communication = PrivacyPreservingCommunication::create_encrypted_channels()?;
//! let intelligent_routing = IntelligentRouting::create_topology_aware_optimization()?;
//! let global_coordination = GlobalCoordination::create_privacy_preserving_efficiency()?;
//! ```
//!
//! ### Anti-Surveillance Network Architecture
//!
//! The networking infrastructure implements sophisticated anti-surveillance protection that
//! prevents network-level metadata analysis while maintaining the coordination capabilities
//! required for consensus, TEE service provision, and cross-chain communication. This
//! protection operates through cryptographic mechanisms that obfuscate communication patterns,
//! timing relationships, and network topology information without compromising network
//! functionality or coordination efficiency.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use aevor_network::{
//!     privacy::{
//!         TrafficObfuscation, TimingObfuscation, SizeObfuscation,
//!         RoutingObfuscation, MetadataObfuscation
//!     },
//!     security::{
//!         NetworkSecurity, ThreatDetection, IntrusionPrevention,
//!         MaliciousBehaviorDetection, AnomlyDetection
//!     }
//! };
//!
//! // Anti-surveillance protection without compromising functionality
//! let traffic_obfuscation = TrafficObfuscation::create_pattern_hiding()?;
//! let timing_obfuscation = TimingObfuscation::create_analysis_resistance()?;
//! let threat_detection = ThreatDetection::create_privacy_aware_monitoring()?;
//! ```
//!
//! ### Intelligent Routing with Topology Privacy
//!
//! The intelligent routing system provides CDN-like performance characteristics through
//! sophisticated optimization algorithms that consider network topology, geographic
//! distribution, latency characteristics, and bandwidth availability while maintaining
//! complete privacy protection for network topology information and routing decisions.
//! This capability enables global performance optimization without revealing sensitive
//! information about network structure or participant relationships.
//!
//! ## Trilemma Transcendence Through Network Coordination
//!
//! ### Performance Enhancement Through Privacy Coordination
//!
//! AEVOR's networking demonstrates genuine blockchain trilemma transcendence by showing
//! how sophisticated privacy protection can enhance rather than compromise network
//! performance through intelligent coordination that eliminates coordination overhead
//! while providing stronger privacy guarantees than traditional approaches.
//!
//! Privacy-preserving routing enables more efficient network utilization by preventing
//! traffic analysis attacks that could compromise network optimization, geographic
//! distribution coordination provides better performance through sophisticated load
//! balancing that maintains privacy boundaries, and anti-snooping protection enables
//! global coordination efficiency by eliminating surveillance overhead and attack
//! mitigation requirements.
//!
//! ### Decentralization Strengthening Through Network Efficiency
//!
//! The networking infrastructure strengthens decentralization by enabling efficient
//! coordination across geographically distributed validators while maintaining privacy
//! protection that prevents coordination analysis from revealing validator relationships
//! or operational patterns. This approach demonstrates how sophisticated networking
//! can make decentralized operation more efficient rather than requiring centralization
//! for performance optimization.
//!
//! ### Scalability Through Geographic Coordination
//!
//! Geographic distribution capabilities enable network performance that scales positively
//! with global adoption while maintaining privacy protection and decentralized operation.
//! The networking infrastructure provides automatic optimization for global performance
//! while ensuring that growth strengthens rather than weakens privacy guarantees and
//! decentralized coordination capabilities.
//!
//! ## Architectural Boundaries and Design Principles
//!
//! ### Infrastructure Capabilities vs Service Policies
//!
//! This networking infrastructure maintains strict separation between networking capabilities
//! that enable unlimited innovation and networking policies that implement specific
//! approaches to network management, security, or optimization. Every networking component
//! provides primitive capabilities rather than embedding specific networking strategies
//! that would constrain application network usage or organizational network customization.
//!
//! ### Global Coordination Without Centralized Dependencies
//!
//! All networking coordination operates through distributed mechanisms that eliminate
//! centralized dependencies while providing global optimization and coordination
//! capabilities. Geographic optimization occurs through sophisticated distributed
//! algorithms rather than centralized coordination services, and performance optimization
//! emerges from intelligent distributed coordination rather than centralized management
//! that could compromise decentralized operation or create single points of failure.
//!
//! ### Privacy Protection Without Surveillance Creation
//!
//! Network monitoring and optimization capabilities provide operational intelligence
//! without creating surveillance capabilities or compromising user privacy. All network
//! analysis operates through privacy-preserving mechanisms that enable network optimization
//! while ensuring that monitoring activities cannot be used to compromise user privacy
//! or analyze user behavior patterns.
