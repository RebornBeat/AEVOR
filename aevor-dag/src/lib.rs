//! # AEVOR-DAG: Revolutionary Dual-DAG Architecture for Parallel Blockchain Execution
//!
//! This crate implements AEVOR's revolutionary dual-DAG architecture that enables genuine
//! parallel execution through sophisticated dependency analysis rather than temporal coordination.
//! The dual-DAG approach transcends traditional blockchain limitations by enabling independent
//! transactions to proceed simultaneously while maintaining mathematical consistency through
//! logical ordering and dependency verification.
//!
//! ## Revolutionary Architecture Principles
//!
//! ### Dual-DAG Parallel Execution Foundation
//! 
//! AEVOR's dual-DAG architecture represents a fundamental breakthrough in blockchain coordination
//! that eliminates sequential processing bottlenecks constraining traditional blockchain systems.
//! Rather than forcing all transactions through sequential validation, the dual-DAG enables
//! sophisticated dependency analysis that identifies which operations can proceed independently
//! while maintaining mathematical guarantees about execution correctness and state consistency.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use aevor_dag::{
//!     micro_dag::{TransactionGraph, DependencyAnalysis, ParallelScheduling},
//!     macro_dag::{BlockCoordination, FrontierManagement, ParallelProduction},
//!     coordination::{MicroMacroCoordination, CrossDagVerification}
//! };
//!
//! // Revolutionary parallel execution coordination
//! let transaction_graph = TransactionGraph::analyze_dependencies(&transactions)?;
//! let parallel_schedule = ParallelScheduling::optimize_for_throughput(&transaction_graph)?;
//! let block_coordination = BlockCoordination::enable_concurrent_production(&parallel_schedule)?;
//! ```
//!
//! ### Uncorrupted Frontier Mathematical Verification
//!
//! The uncorrupted frontier represents the advancing edge of mathematically verified blockchain
//! state where every transaction and block has undergone comprehensive verification through
//! TEE attestation and dependency analysis. Unlike traditional blockchain systems where
//! confirmation represents probabilistic confidence, the uncorrupted frontier provides
//! mathematical proof of execution correctness with hardware-backed attestation.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use aevor_dag::{
//!     macro_dag::{UncorruptedFrontier, FrontierAdvancement, CorruptionDetection},
//!     verification::{MathematicalVerification, IntegrityVerification}
//! };
//!
//! // Mathematical frontier advancement with verification
//! let frontier = UncorruptedFrontier::identify_current_state(&blockchain_state)?;
//! let advancement = FrontierAdvancement::coordinate_mathematical_progression(&frontier)?;
//! let verification = MathematicalVerification::verify_frontier_integrity(&advancement)?;
//! ```
//!
//! ### Privacy Boundary Management Across DAG Execution
//!
//! Privacy coordination within the dual-DAG architecture enables sophisticated confidentiality
//! models where different transactions can have different privacy characteristics while
//! maintaining mathematical verification and parallel execution capabilities. Privacy boundaries
//! are enforced through cryptographic mechanisms and TEE coordination rather than coordination
//! overhead that could constrain performance.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use aevor_dag::{
//!     privacy::{BoundaryManagement, CrossPrivacyCoordination, SelectiveDisclosure},
//!     micro_dag::{PrivacyCoordination, ConfidentialityPreservation}
//! };
//!
//! // Privacy coordination with parallel execution
//! let privacy_boundaries = BoundaryManagement::define_mathematical_enforcement(&privacy_policy)?;
//! let cross_privacy = CrossPrivacyCoordination::enable_secure_interaction(&privacy_boundaries)?;
//! let parallel_privacy = PrivacyCoordination::coordinate_with_parallel_execution(&cross_privacy)?;
//! ```
//!
//! ## Dependency-Based Coordination vs Temporal Synchronization
//!
//! Traditional blockchain systems rely on temporal coordination that creates synchronization
//! bottlenecks and prevents parallel execution of independent operations. AEVOR's dependency-based
//! coordination analyzes logical relationships between operations to enable optimal parallel
//! execution while maintaining mathematical consistency about execution outcomes.
//!
//! ### Logical Ordering for Parallel Execution
//!
//! Logical ordering eliminates external timing dependencies while enabling sophisticated
//! coordination through mathematical analysis of operation dependencies. This approach
//! provides stronger guarantees about execution correctness while enabling parallel
//! processing that scales with available computational resources.
//!
//! ### Mathematical Verification Without Coordination Overhead
//!
//! The dual-DAG architecture provides mathematical verification through TEE attestation
//! and dependency analysis rather than coordination overhead that constrains parallel
//! execution. Mathematical certainty emerges from architectural design rather than
//! computational verification requiring sequential processing.
