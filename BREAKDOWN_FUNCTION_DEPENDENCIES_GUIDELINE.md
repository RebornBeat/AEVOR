# BREAKDOWN_FUNCTION_DEPENDENCIES.md Guideline

## Purpose
The purpose of BREAKDOWN_FUNCTION_DEPENDENCIES.md is to provide a detailed analysis of the dependencies and relationships between function blocks within the codebase.

## Structure
1. Module-level Function Dependencies:
   - For each module, identify the key function blocks and their dependencies on function blocks from other modules
   - Provide a brief description of each function block and its purpose

2. File-level Function Dependencies:
   - Within each module, list the files and their dependencies on function blocks from other files within the same module or across different modules
   - Identify the specific function blocks within each file that have dependencies on function blocks from other files

3. Function Block Signatures:
   - Provide the signatures of the function blocks, including the function name, input parameters, and return types
   - Use consistent formatting to represent the function signatures

4. Dependency Direction:
   - Clearly indicate the direction of dependencies between function blocks (e.g., Function A calls Function B, Function X depends on Function Y)
   - Use appropriate formatting or symbols to denote the direction of dependencies

5. Dependency Type:
   - Specify the type of dependency between function blocks (e.g., direct function call, event-driven, data-driven)
   - Use consistent terminology and formatting to denote the type of dependencies

6. Criticality and Impact:
   - Assess the criticality and impact of each function block dependency
   - Identify dependencies that are critical for the functioning of the codebase and highlight them accordingly

7. Optimization Opportunities:
   - Identify any redundant or duplicated function blocks across the codebase
   - Suggest potential optimizations or refactoring opportunities to eliminate duplication and improve code reusability

## Best Practices
- Keep the documentation up to date with the codebase
- Use clear and consistent formatting throughout the document
- Provide examples or code snippets to illustrate complex function block dependencies
- Regularly review and update the document as the codebase evolves
